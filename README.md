# The Wild Oasis

A React Project to practice (React Query, Styled Components, React Hook Form, Supabase, advanced compound component pattern, authentication, charts, dark mode, professional application planning and development).

The Wild Oasis is a comprehensive Cabin Management and Booking App, empowering cabin administrators with CRUD operations on cabins, users, and bookings. Additionally, the app facilitates receptionists in adding bookings, checking in guests, and processing check-outs.

During this project, I did:
- Utilized JavaScript and React.js for frontend development and incorporated React Query, React Form, and styled-components to create a responsive and user-friendly web application.
- Integrated Supabase as a backend to manage and store data, ensuring data integrity and security.
- Implemented admin capabilities for CRUD operations on cabins, users, and bookings, streamlining the management of cabin facilities and customer data.
- Designed features for receptionists to efficiently add bookings, check-in guests, and process check-outs, enhancing the guest experience.
